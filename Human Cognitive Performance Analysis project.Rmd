# üß† Introduction


Have you ever wondered how stress, sleep, screen time, and lifestyle habits influence our memory and cognitive skills? In today‚Äôs data-driven world, we can explore those questions through the power of data wrangling. This tutorial is designed for beginner R users who are comfortable with the basics of R but new to using the tidyverse to clean, manipulate, and visualize messy datasets


üìä About the Dataset
The dataset used in this tutorial is titled Human Cognitive Performance Analysis, and it is publicly available on Kaggle. It was published by user **samxsam** in 2023(It was updated on 04/02/2025) and includes simulated data from 80,000 individuals aged 18‚Äì59.

The dataset records 13 variables, including:

- **Demographics**: `Age`, `Gender`  
- **Health habits**: `Sleep_Duration`, `Diet_Type`, `Caffeine_Intake`, `Exercise_Frequency`  
- **Behavioral factors**: `Stress_Level`, `Daily_Screen_Time`  
- **Cognitive metrics**: `Reaction_Time`, `Memory_Test_Score`, `Cognitive_Score`, `AI_Predicted_Score`

This simulated dataset provides a realistic scenario for exploring how everyday habits may relate to cognitive performance. While it does not represent real medical data, it offers a valuable opportunity to practice data wrangling techniques with real-world context.

# üìÇ Loading and Exploring the Data

To begin, we load the dataset using `read_csv()` and take a first look at the structure using `glimpse()`. This helps us understand the number of rows, variables, and data types we‚Äôre working with.


```{r}
#Loading dataset
cog_data <- read_csv("human_cognitive_performance.csv")
glimpse(cog_data)
```

# üßπ Step 1: Cleaning the Data

We‚Äôll start cleaning our dataset by renaming the columns to more consistent and readable names using `rename()`. Then, we‚Äôll use `filter()` to remove rows with missing values in key variables. This ensures our data is tidy and ready for analysis.


```{r}
# Rename columns manually for consistency
cog_data <- cog_data %>%
  rename(
    user_id = User_ID,
    age = Age,
    gender = Gender,
    sleep = Sleep_Duration,
    stress = Stress_Level,
    diet_type = Diet_Type,
    screen_time = Daily_Screen_Time,
    exercise_frequency = Exercise_Frequency,
    caffeine_intake = Caffeine_Intake,
    reaction_time = Reaction_Time,
    memory = Memory_Test_Score,
    cognitive = Cognitive_Score,
    ai_predicted_score = AI_Predicted_Score
  )

# Remove rows with missing key values
cog_clean <- cog_data %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(memory),
    !is.na(cognitive),
    !is.na(gender),
    !is.na(stress)
  )

# Let's take a look  at cleaned data
glimpse(cog_clean)


```
This summary tells us that our dataset includes 80,000 observations across 13 variables. It contains both numeric and categorical data, such as:

- **Age** ranges from 18 to 59, with an average of about 38.5 years.
- **Sleep duration** varies from 4 to 10 hours, averaging around 7.
- **Stress level** ranges from 1 to 10, with a median of 5.
- **Cognitive and memory scores** range from 0 to 100, with mean memory around 69.5 and cognitive around 58.2.

This overview helps us understand the scale and type of data we‚Äôre working with before moving on to wrangling and visualization.


# üîÑ Step 2: Creating New Variables and Summarizing
In this step, we‚Äôll use `mutate()` to create new variables that make our data easier to analyze. Specifically, we‚Äôll group stress levels into categories and create age groups. Then, we‚Äôll use `group_by()` and `summarise()` to explore average memory and cognitive scores across these categories.


```{r}
# Creating a new variable for stress categories
cog_clean <- cog_clean %>%
  mutate(stress_cat = case_when(
    stress <= 3 ~ "Low",
    stress <= 7 ~ "Medium",
    TRUE ~ "High"
  ))

# Creating age group categories
cog_clean <- cog_clean %>%
  mutate(age_group = case_when(
    age < 25 ~ "18‚Äì24",
    age < 35 ~ "25‚Äì34",
    age < 45 ~ "35‚Äì44",
    age < 55 ~ "45‚Äì54",
    TRUE ~ "55‚Äì59"
  ))

# Summarize average memory and cognitive score by stress category
stress_summary <- cog_clean %>%
  group_by(stress_cat) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_memory = mean(memory),
    avg_cognitive = mean(cognitive),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

stress_summary

```
This summary table shows the average memory and cognitive scores across different stress categories.

- Individuals with **low stress** have the **highest average cognitive score** (~64.6), while those with **high stress** have the **lowest** (~51.8).
- Interestingly, **memory scores remain fairly consistent** across all groups, hovering around 69.4‚Äì69.6.

These results suggest that while stress might not heavily impact memory, it appears to be linked to a noticeable drop in overall cognitive performance.




# üìä Step 3: Visualizing the Data

Now that we‚Äôve wrangled and summarized our dataset, let‚Äôs visualize some of the patterns to better understand how variables like stress and sleep relate to cognitive performance.

We‚Äôll use `ggplot2` to create two informative graphics:
1. A bar chart showing average memory scores across stress categories
2. A scatter plot showing the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive scores


First, we‚Äôll plot the average memory score for each stress category. This helps us visually compare how memory performance changes across different stress levels.


```{r}
ggplot(stress_summary, aes(x = stress_cat, y = avg_memory, fill = stress_cat)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs( #Adding title and x, y 
    title = "Average Memory Score by Stress Category",
    x = "Stress Category",
    y = "Average Memory Score"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

This bar chart shows the average memory scores across different stress levels. Interestingly, the scores are **very similar**, regardless of stress category ‚Äî all hovering around 69.4 to 69.6. This suggests that **stress may not have a strong effect on memory performance** in this dataset. However, we‚Äôll need to look at other variables (like cognitive score) to see if stress influences different aspects of mental performance.





Next, let‚Äôs try a scatter plot! We‚Äôll use it to see if there‚Äôs any relationship between how much people sleep and how well they perform on cognitive tests. We‚Äôll use two variables: **hours of sleep** and **cognitive score**, and plot the correlation between them.
 


```{r}
ggplot(cog_clean, aes(x = sleep, y = cognitive)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = "steelblue") + #adding color 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Cognitive Score vs. Sleep Duration",
    x = "Hours of Sleep",
    y = "Cognitive Score"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() #using theme minimal
```
This scatter plot shows the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive score. Each point represents an individual‚Äôs cognitive score based on how many hours of sleep they got.

While the data points are spread out, the red trend line (generated with `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`) shows a **slight positive correlation** ‚Äî suggesting that people who sleep more tend to have slightly higher cognitive scores.

# üìåConclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to clean and wrangle a real-world dataset on human cognitive performance using the dplyr package in R. Through filtering, mutating, summarizing, and visualizing the data, we uncovered some interesting patterns.

Key takeaway:

Stress levels appeared to have little effect on memory, but higher stress was linked to lower cognitive scores.

Sleep duration showed a slight positive relationship with cognitive performance, suggesting that more sleep may support better mental function.

These results are valuable because they highlight how simple lifestyle factors ‚Äî like stress and sleep ‚Äî could influence cognitive abilities.
This project demonstrates the power of data wrangling to turn messy information into clear insights. Whether you‚Äôre preparing data for analysis or creating visualizations to share findings, tidy data and thoughtful exploration are key.
